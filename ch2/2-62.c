 *
 * Write a function int_shifts_are_logical() that yields 1 when run on a
 * machine that uses logical right shifts for data type int and yields 0
 * otherwise. Your code should work on a machine with any word size.
 * Test your cod on several machines.

 * EPILOGUE
 *
 * There are many solutions to solve this problem, but it's a little bit
 * tricky to write one that works for any word size. The above code is
 * our solution that perform a right shift of a word in which all bits
 * are sit to 1. If the shift mode is arithmetic, the resulting word
 * will still have all bits set to 1.*/
